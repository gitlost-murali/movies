    "text": "The story\nThe movie opens with India’s top dignitaries calling for a global conference inviting all the women leaders from around the world to come to India. The reason for this conference is revealed through a journalist’s reporting - there has been a 20-year decline in the birth rate across the world, and it is all because of a decision made by women.\nIn a shocking revelation, it is revealed that all women around the world have decided to stop giving birth. This decision was made after years of being overlooked, oppressed, and not having control over their bodies. Women decided that the best way to get society to listen to them was by hitting where it hurts the most - the continuation of the human race.\nThe news spreads like wildfire, and men all over the world are outraged. The world’s major religions come together to condemn the decision, and governments begin to take drastic measures to reverse the decline in population. But as much as they try, nothing seems to work. The strike seems to be holding strong, and there is no sign of women relenting. As the governments become more and more desperate to increase the birth rate, they start taking extreme measures. They offer financial incentives to couples who have more than two children, and they even start forcing women to have children (paradoxical) by intercourse or through artificial insemination (again, beats the point). The situation becomes even more complicated when the men’s religions decide to stop donating sperm, making it even harder for the governments to increase the birth rate. As the world’s population continues to decline, the government and religious leaders become increasingly desperate. They start offering financial incentives for having children and enforcing laws that make it mandatory for women to have babies. Revising religious texts which were patriarchal.\nAmidst all this chaos, we follow the story of a young woman named Nisha, who is a staunch supporter of the strike. She has seen her mother and grandmother suffer at the hands of a patriarchal society and believes that this is the only way to bring about change. However, as the situation becomes more dire, Nisha starts to question whether the strike is the right way to bring about change.\nClimax [TODO]"
